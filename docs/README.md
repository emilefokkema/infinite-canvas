`InfiniteCanvas` is like a `<canvas>` element that is infinite in size. It can be panned, zoomed and rotated using touch gestures or the mouse. It exposes a [`CanvasRenderingContext2D`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CanvasRenderingContext2D), just like the `<canvas>` itself. Contrary to many canvas-based libraries, it does *not* maintain an object model of what has been drawn on the canvas. Its focus is on enabling panning, zooming and rotating. And on infinity, of course.
